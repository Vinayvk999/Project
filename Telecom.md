Explanation:
Ingest Data (Bronze Layer):

Ingests data from multiple sources (Oracle, SQL Server, CSV files) to the Bronze Layer using the CopyActivity.
IngestBillingData, IngestCRMData, and IngestCDRData are different activities for each source.
Data Transformation (Silver Layer):

TransformBillingData, TransformCRMData, and TransformCDRData transform raw data using Databricks and Data Flow activities.
The data is cleansed and enriched, moving to the Silver Layer.
Data Validation:

The ValidateData activity performs data quality checks using Data Flow.
Loading to Gold Layer:

The LoadToGoldLayer activity loads validated data into Azure Synapse Analytics, where it's stored in the Gold Layer for analytics.
Real-Time Ingestion:

RealTimeIngestion processes real-time network logs using Azure Stream Analytics and writes to the Gold Layer.
Monitoring:

The MonitorPipeline activity posts the status of the pipeline execution to a monitoring endpoint.
